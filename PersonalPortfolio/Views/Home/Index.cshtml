                <p>This site contains humorous faux exotic recipes. The "search" page allows the user to view the entire database of recipes, search the database by keyword, select particular recipes, view the details of the recipe such as ingredients and instructions, and to print a page of the details. I encourage you to visit the site, and have a hearty chuckle at the zany cuisine.</p>
